# Blender renderings performed on Google Colab and Kaggle


The second cell in this Jupyter notebook  [this Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/Blender_python/blob/main/Visualisation_d'un_visage_3D_sur_Blender.ipynb) allows you to install Blender on Colab and convert the file “/content/file.obj” to “content/file.blend.”
The third cell in this same Jupyter Notebook generates five different renderings to give an idea of the position parameters to be modified (camera position vector and orientation position vector). It would be a good idea to create a clickable button to select the best perspective on the object.



Here an output [example](https://github.com/ZygoOoade/Blender_python/blob/main/3D%20renderings/visage.png)
